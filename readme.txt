Make your RSS feeds human-readable. Simply click install and you're good to go!

== Description ==

Improve RSS Feeds uses XSLT to improve the appearance of your RSS feeds and make them human-readable. This plugin also adds subscription buttons and social sharing buttons to your RSS Feeds.

Your blog's RSS feed is located at http://yoursite.com/feed/ (if you use permalinks) or http://yoursite.com/?feed=rss2 (if you don't use permalinks).

Some users already have an RSS viewer installed on their browsers, so their RSS feeds are already human-readable. However, most users (especially on Google Chrome or Apple Safari) do not have an RSS viewer. This plugin makes your RSS feeds accessible to those users.
